[Tomáš](/mancal), [Matteo](/group/bruschi), and [Kateřina](/group/charvatova) participated in the "Den s kvantovkou" (Day with Quantum Mechanics) event held on September 25, 2025, at Troja campus of Charles University. The aim of this yearly event, organized by the Faculty of Mathematics and Physics (CUNI) in collaboration with other institutions (ČVUT, IBM, FZU AV ČR, ZČU, PřF UPOL), is to popularize quantum mechanics and related fields among high school students and teachers and show them the exciting research conducted at CUNI. Our group presented several hands-on experiments and demonstrations related to quantum mechanics, spectroscopy, and biophysics of photosynthesis.
