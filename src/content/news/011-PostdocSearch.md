We have a postdoc position available in theory of multi-excitonic dynamics and interaction. Within a project "Multi-exciton ultrafast energy transfer processes in molecular systems with quantum environment" funded by the Czech Science foundation (26-23570S, 2026-2028), we will together with František Šanda (MFF CU) and our experimental collaborators Jürgen Hauer (TU Munich) and Tobias Brixner (Uni Würzburg) investigate how multiple excitons travel and interact in molecular systems, and which signals can be used to track these processes in time-resolved optical spectroscopy. 
The successful candidate will have experience in theory of open quantum systems, optical nonlinear spectroscopy, and exciton dynamics. The research entails diverse kinds of theoretical description, ranging from ab-initio quantum chemistry to Frenkel exciton model to nonlinear response functions to master equations for excitonic dynamics. Interested candidates should <a href='/contacts'> contact either Tomáš Mančal or Pavel Malý. </a>
