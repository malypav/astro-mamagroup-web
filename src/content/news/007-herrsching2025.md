In the beginning of September 2025 our group attended the international meeting "Ultrafast dynamics in photochemistry and biology - Theory meets experiment 2025" held in [Herrsching am Ammersee](https://www.hdbl-herrsching.de/), Bavaria, Germany, organized by Prof. Jürgen Hauer (TUM) and Dr. František Šanda (CUNI) with the financial support of [Bavarian-Czech Academic Agency](https://www.btha.cz/en/) and by the [TUM-NAT gradschool](https://www.nat.tum.de/nat/wir/gs/). It was a great and enriching couple of days full of interesting talks and discussions.
