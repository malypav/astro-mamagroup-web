[Pavel](/maly), [Matteo](/group/bruschi), [Malcolm](/group/garrow), and [Michal](/group/ptacek) attended the "Extended Hanseatic meeting on Exciton Dynamics and Spectroscopy" (EEDS 2025) held in Vilnius, Lithuania, from September 30 to October 2, 2025 at the Center for Physical Sciences and Technology, Vilnius University. Additionally, the "International HPC Competence Workshop" and the "PhotoCam Entrepreneurship Workshop: From Lab to Market" for doctoral students were held the day before and after the meeting, respectively. Everyone enjoyed the event greatly as it involved many interesting talks, fruitful discussions, and (most importantly) networking opportunities for students and researchers from various institutions across Europe.

Thanks to the organizing comittee, and especially to Prof. Darius Abramavičius (Vilnius University), for the opportunity to participate in this inspiring meeting and we look forward to the next edition!
