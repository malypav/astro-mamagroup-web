At the end of February, our entire group went to a winter school and a workshop taking place at Ècole de physique Des Houches in French Alps. 

[Tomáš](/mancal) and [Vláďa](/group/slama) were one of the main speakers during the first week, holding several lectures and a very positively received hands-on practical session focused on the quantarhei Python package. Evenings were dedicated to single slide presentations of students. All of us, namely [Michal](/group/ptacek), [Veronika](/group/vrankova), [Kačka](/group/charvatova), [Malcolm](/group/garrow), and [May](/group/shein), had a talk there.

During the second week, [Tomáš](/mancal), [Vláďa](/group/slama), and [Pavel](/maly) had talks about their current research, while František and [Matteo](/group/bruschi) attended the poster session.
